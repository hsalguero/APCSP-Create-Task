        Welcome to UCVTS, freshmen! This is a text-based adventure where you choose how you want to spend your day at one of New Jersey's best school districts.
      </h3>
      <h2>
        You party so much in shady Japanese nightclubs that you come across a tall, muscular yakuza gang member who wants your money. You refuse to hand over the two dollars you have in your pocket. An action movie fight scene plays out and he pushes you off the roof of the nightclub to your death. Sayonara Sucker!
