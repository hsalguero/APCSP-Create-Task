      <h2>
         You swing to the scene of the crime and find Mr. Blokus being mugged by a man in a mask. You battle it out with the masked man until he surrenders and reveals himself to be the reincarnation of AMEDEO AVOGADRO! He summons an army of moles that you try your hardest to fight off but end up getting overwhelmed and failing your mission. <br>
